 * A regular-schmegular, normal human.

You are standing in the kitchen. This is where delicious smells sometimes come
from.
Exits:
South to Living Room

You see:
 * a plastic cat-food bowl
        meow at bowl



After meowing at the bowl, your human comes to the kitchen. They notice your
bowl is empty and finds your canned food. They then fill your bowl up. From the
kitchen they can see what's going on in the living room and become more alert.

You are standing on top of the table. There is stuff on the table.
Exits:
Down to Living Room

You see:
 * a plastic cup with no water in it
        push cup
 * a mug with cartoon smile face
        push mug



"HEY! No, no, no!" Your human looks at you from the kitchen as you nudge the cup
around. They keep an eye on you, preventing you from doing anything else.
"Hey, hey, hey!" your human frowns at you and reaches their hand out to hold the
mug in place. "Don't touch this, ok?"

"Hey, no!" your human grabs the cup before it  can fall. "This has juice in it,
ok?" They move it back in place.

Exits:

You are standing in the bathroom. You don't like it when your human puts water
on you.
Exits:
South to Bedroom

You see:
 * a toilet paper roll
        play with paper



You, the cat, swat at the toilet paper end hanging from the holder. You play
with the toilet paper roll and completely unravel it. The holder comes toppling
down.
Your human hears you, comes to the bathroom, and stands at the doorframe in
shock.
Letting out a sigh, your human gets busy, cleaning up the pile.

You see:
 * a plastic cup with no water in it
        push cup
 * a mug with cartoon smile face
        push mug



You nudge the plastic cup with the top of your head.  It reaches the edge of the
table and you soon see it fall to the ground. Juice spills everywhere, but the
plastic cup is fine. You let out a disappointed meow.

You, the cat, slowly push your paw against the mug's surface. It inches towards
the edge of the table. You then see it tumble onto the floor and BANG. It
shatters and tea spashes everywhere.
You pushed your human's mug! As it tumbles towards the ground, you watch with a
glint in your eye. The satisfying crash echoes through the house, a symphony of
sweet revenge for last night's dinner fiasco. You've proven that even the
smallest creature can make a big statement. Well done, stealthy feline! ~(OuO)~
